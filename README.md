Migrating my current Tetris game ([js-tetris](https://github.com/jareddgotte/js-tetris)) to Electron with the end goal of properly incorporating linting, TypeScript, React, SASS, webpack, and yarn.

## How to use:
1. Clone this git repo; e.g.:
   * `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/jareddgotte/electris.git`
2. Do `yarn install` or `npm install` to populate the local "./node_modules" folder
3. Do `yarn build` or `npm run build` to compile the "./dist" files
4. Then do `yarn start` or `npm start` to launch the game
   * Alternatively, if you open up the project in VSCode, you just have to press F5 for steps 3 and 4
